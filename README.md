# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles designed to work on all of my devices with no individual configurations needed for each device. 

## Requirements

#### Operating System

I do most of my testing on Arch Linux as it has become my daily driver. Slowly I'm trying to make it all less distro-exclusive.

#### Display

This set of dotfiles assumes a display of 1920x1080 or smaller resolution. For HiDPI displays, go to [the HiDPI dots repo](https://github.com/astrakk/dots-hidpi)
